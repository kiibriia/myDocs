Hello! 

I am UI/UX designer with 12 years of experience, I am writing to
apply for the Product Designer position. I am confident that my relevant
design experience will help me be an asset to your team.

I have experience in designing and implementing websites and apps from
start to finish, including wireframes, mockups, prototyping, and testing. I
also have experience in designing user interfaces for touch-screen devices
and optimizing for different screen sizes.

I think you will be impressed by my work samples, which are attached
below. I would love the chance to meet with you and learn more about your
company's needs so we can discuss how best to move forward together.



Sincerely,

Golam Kibria
